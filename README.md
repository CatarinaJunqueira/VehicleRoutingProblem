Project Title  --  Parcel Delivery Optimization

Description –

                Problem – With increasing number of parcel deliveries there is always a need to find a quick path that leads to delivering all the parcels, with less time, less distance, less number of delivery executives, etc..
                Our idea – Taking into consideration the generalized “VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM” we will try to implement an algorithm that will return an optimal path that each delivery executive is required to take in order to efficiently deliver all parcels. We will also try to reduce the number of delivery executives required.
